## Setting the Tone with a Piezo Buzzer
Inventor's Kit Tutorial

[toc]

### Objective and Experiment
* learn how is Piezo Buzzer works
* learn additional Microbit function `analog pitch(value1, value2)`

### Parts Used  
* Piezo is a device/sensor can generate electricity when there is a pressure apply to it, reversely, it vibrates when electicity is apply to it;  pressure -> <- electricity.

### Software Components 
* `pins -> analog set pitch pin(P0)`
* `input -> on button pressed(A)`
* `pins -> analog pitch(frequency, duration in ms)`
